 through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla,
 WA,Magic City, ID,Bountiful,UT,Last Chance , Co,
 Why,Az and Truth or Consequerces,NM.

<h2>July 14,2012</h2>
<p>I saw some Burma Shrma style signs on the side of the
road today:"Passing cars, when you can't see,May get you,A glimose,
Of eternity." I definiitely won't be passing and cars.

My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got 
eberything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway. I wasn't
able to bring a whole lot with me:
</P>
<ul>
  <li>cell phone</li>
  <li>iPod</li>
  <li>digital camera</li>
  <li>and a protein bar</li>
</ul>
<p>
cell phone,iPod,
digital camera,and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao tzu would
have said,"A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segay."
